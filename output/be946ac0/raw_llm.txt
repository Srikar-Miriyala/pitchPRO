  "tagline": "Orbital Energy: Delivering Constant, Clean Power from Space, Day and Night.",
  "elevator_pitch": "We're developing a space-based solar power system that captures solar energy in orbit and beams it to Earth via microwaves, providing an uninterrupted, clean energy source unaffected by terrestrial conditions.",
  "executive_summary": "Our startup, Orbital Energy Solutions, is pioneering the development of a revolutionary space-based solar power (SBSP) system. This innovative technology will deploy large solar arrays in geostationary orbit, where sunlight is constant and intense, free from atmospheric interference. The collected energy will then be converted into microwaves and safely transmitted to rectifying antennas (rectennas) on Earth, delivering a continuous, dispatchable, and carbon-free power supply. Unlike traditional renewables, SBSP operates 24/7, overcoming intermittency challenges and offering a scalable solution to meet the world's growing energy demand while significantly reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change.",
