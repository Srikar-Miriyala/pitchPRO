  "elevator_pitch": "We're building a direct farmer-to-customer marketplace that cuts out middlemen, ensuring farmers receive fair compensation and consumers get fresher produce at better prices, all optimized by AI-driven price predictions.",
  "executive_summary": "Our platform revolutionizes the agricultural supply chain by creating a direct farmer-to-customer marketplace for vegetables, grains, and fruits. We eliminate costly middlemen, allowing farmers to earn significantly more for their produce while offering consumers fresher, higher-quality goods at competitive prices. A core differentiator is our proprietary AI-based price prediction engine, which analyzes market data, weather patterns, and supply/demand to suggest optimal pricing, ensuring fairness and maximizing value for both parties. This model addresses critical inefficiencies in the current system, fostering sustainable farming practices and empowering local economies by connecting producers directly with their end consumers.",
