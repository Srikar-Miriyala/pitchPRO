  "speaker_notes": "Today's K-12 education system, while foundational, often struggles with a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. This leads to significant challenges: students either get bored because they're not challenged, or they fall behind because the pace is too fast. Teachers, despite their best efforts, lack the resources and time to truly personalize learning for each student in a classroom of 30 or more. This systemic issue contributes to disengagement and persistent achievement gaps."
