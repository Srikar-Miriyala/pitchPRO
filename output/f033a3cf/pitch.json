      "speaker_notes": "Our answer is EcoBrick Innovations. We produce two types of advanced, eco-friendly bricks. Fly-ash blocks repurpose industrial waste, diverting it from landfills and creating a strong, durable building material. Compressed Earth Blocks, or CEBs, use readily available local soil, compacted under high pressure with minimal energy input. Both offer superior performance compared to traditional bricks, including better insulation and consistent quality, all while eliminating the need for polluting kilns."
